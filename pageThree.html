                <p class ="borderText">Today I had to miss the session as I was ill, but I emailed in and asked for the resources. The project to write this journal was set. I managed to understand most of what was taught including some last touches on JavaScript (objects) and a basic introduction to HTML.</p>

                <p class ="borderText">In the morning, Paul ran through some basics for MySQL and introduced us to using SQL fiddle. I did find the syntax a little confusing at first as I would forget how to write everything out properly and got a couple of errors when trying to build my schema, but I got there after some practise. In the afternoon, we went over more html, some information about different tags, how to link images and other pages using the nav tag</p>

                <strong class="miniHead2">Wednesday:</strong>
                <p class ="borderText">In the morning, we were set a task to create a powerpoint about a specific property in CSS. I was assigned "Background" with one of my peers, Jamie. We were alotted some time to talk together in a breakout room, so Jamie and I assigned each other some information to gather and write out some slides in Powerpoint.</p>

                <p class ="borderText">On Thursday, we recapped some SQL and talked about querying an SQL database with statements such as WHERE, comparison operators etc. We were then set some tasks to go through and submit for the following week that I started in the afternoon. I struggled a bit at first but after doing some research and re reading through the brief, looking at some examples, it made more sense.  </p>

                <strong class="miniHead2">Friday:</strong>
                <p class ="borderText">In the morning, we all had to present our small CSS projects. I felt mine went well apart from a small error on one of my slides (I used the british english spelling of "Colour"). After the powerpoints, we were given some time to work on our html projects. I was getting a little frustrated at this point as I wasn't sure how to structure it and felt a bit overwhelmed by my options. In the afternoon we had our 2nd careers session with Zoe. We talked about what makes a good CV and cover letter.</p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the days section, I was getting a little frustrated with how to set out my project, and with myself for missing Monday's session as playing catch-up definitely hurt my initial understanding. I was using the tags a little incorrectly at this point.  </p>

<div class="probs-solutions2">
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>As a solution to my frustration I went over some of the html and css content again, looked at examples of w3 schools and drew out what I wanted my layout to be. That's how I came up with the idea to separate my days into boxes on the left side of the screen and put my "problems and solutions" on the right.</p>
