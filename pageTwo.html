We also discussed operators did some basic maths using variables. Template literals were mentioned, which was interesting as I hadn't heard of them before.</p>

In the afternoon, we had our first careers session which was mainly just an introduction and talking about what we'd cover in the future. </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>As it was the first week of the course, I didn't find myself having too many challenges. However, the JavaScript tasks that we did on Friday did take me a lot longer than I was expecting before they clicked. The idea of for loops and arrays did throw me a little at first.</p>

        <div class="probs-solutions2">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>To remedy my issues with arrays and for loops, I did a little bit of reading on W3 schools and a couple of challenges on CodeWars to build my confidence. In regards to the friday JavaScript tasks, I had to just keep thinking about the questions and looking back over the work I had done in the week before I solved them</p>
